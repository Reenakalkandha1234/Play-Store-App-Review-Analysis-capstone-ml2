📍 Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store app data to uncover meaningful insights about app performance, ratings, installs, and user engagement.
By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistics, we identify patterns that inform developers, marketers, and product strategists.

🔍 Objective of the Project

The key objectives of this project are:
Understand key factors influencing app success
Explore patterns between rating, reviews, installs and pricing
Identify high-performing categories
Analyze market competition and install distribution
Offer actionable insights for business decisions

🧠 Problem Statement

Users largely depend on ratings and installs when selecting apps.
However, developers lack analytical insight into:
Which categories succeed more?
Does higher rating guarantee more installs?
What drives user engagement?
This project investigates these challenges using real dataset analysis.

✔ Step 6: Findings and conclusion
🎯 Key Insights

Most apps are rated between 3.5 and 4.5
Free apps dominate install volume
Installs strongly correlate with reviews
App category influences app count and installs
Ratings alone do not guarantee app downloads

📌 Conclusion
